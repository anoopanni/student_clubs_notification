step 1. Install Docker Desktop Client.
step 2. Execute the following command from terminal with root directory of the project as current directory: make build.
step 3. Access the website by hitting http://localhost:8050 from the browser. The current port is set to 8050, we can change this in DockerFile and docker-compose.yaml.


All the build instructions is on Makefile. The following commands are useful in handling docker containers in an efficient way :

a) make down: 
            This will stop all the running containers and remove network.
b) make logs: 
            Provides logs of the running container. This can be used to check python Flask logs.
c) make exec: 
            Can be used to get inside the container and connect to the bash tty. 
d) make prune: 
            used to clear all the stale containers, images, volumes, networks
